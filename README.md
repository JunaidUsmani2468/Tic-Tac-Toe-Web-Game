# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Web Game

Welcome to the digital arena of X's and O's! This isn't just your average paper-and-pencil game; it is a fully interactive web experience designed specifically for the **big screen**.

I built this project to engineer a robust state-management system in vanilla JavaScript. Beyond just checking for a winner, the game features a sleek **purple-themed UI optimized for Desktop/PC**, **real-time score tracking** to settle those "best of 3" arguments, and a **smart turn-switching logic** that rewards the winner with the first move in the next round.

### 🚀 Live Demo:

> **⚠️ Mobile Users Beware:** This game is currently **PC Only**. If you open this on your phone, the UI might look a little... abstract (broken). Please use a Laptop or PC for the best experience! 💻

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Smooth 3x3 grid for two players (X and O).
- **Smart Turn Logic:**
  - The game always starts with **Player O**.
  - **Winner Starts:** To keep things fair, the winner of the previous match gets the first turn in the next round!
- **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of wins for both Player X and Player O.
- **Match Statistics:** Tracks Total Matches Played and Total Draws.
- **Winner Announcement:** A custom popup modal announces the winner or if the game is a draw.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** - For structure and layout.
- **CSS3** - For styling, flexbox/grid layout, and the purple color scheme.
- **JavaScript (ES6)** - For game logic, DOM manipulation, and state management.

## 🚀 How to Play

1.  Clone the repository
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3.  **Round 1:** Player **O** makes the first move.
4.  **Subsequent Rounds:** The winner of the last game gets the advantage of moving first!
5.  Try to align 3 symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

This project helped strengthen my understanding of:

- DOM Manipulation (selecting elements, event listeners).
- Advanced Game Logic (managing turns based on previous winners).
- CSS Flexbox and positioning.
- Handling JavaScript arrays and loops for winning patterns.

## 👏 Acknowledgements

This project was initially built under the guidance of **Shradha Khapra** (Apna College).

I extended the original tutorial by adding my own custom features:
* **Real-time Score Tracking** (Total Matches & Draws).
* **Custom UI Design** with a purple theme.
