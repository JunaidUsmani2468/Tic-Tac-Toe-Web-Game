## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Smooth 3x3 grid for two players (X and O).
- **Smart Turn Logic:**
  - The game always starts with **Player O**.
  - **Winner Starts:** To keep things fair, the winner of the previous match gets the first turn in the next round!

- **Match Statistics:** Tracks Total Matches Played and Total Draws.
- **Winner Announcement:** A custom popup modal announces the winner or if the game is a draw.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** - For structure and layout.
- **CSS3** - For styling, flexbox/grid layout, and the purple color scheme.
